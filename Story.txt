Hi, I have completed the project "US Crime Data Exploration and Analysis" in Tableau so that it would be easy to show the data clearly.
This project involves US Crime Data of the year 2022.
Problem Objective: It is required to delve deeper into data on different types of crimes and figure out the types of crimes which are more frequent
                   and how they are trending over time.

Step-1: Open Tableau.
Step-2: Click 'connect' button and select text file.
Step-3: Select 'Crime_us' XLS file and open it in tableau.
Step-4: We can see the 'Crime_us' dataset in Data Source label. To make charts click on Sheets which can be visible below. Here we can create any charts, graphs that we want.
Step-5: First, we need to display different types of crimes in US so we need to take 'Primary type' data column and into the sheet with 'ID' column as count.With bar chart
        we can see 31 types of crimes and their total count.
Step-6: Here, I have taken the TOP 10 crimes they are: THEFT, BATTERY, CRIMINAL DAMAGE, ASSAULT, MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT, DECEPTIVE PRACTICE, OTHER OFFENSE, ROBBERY, WEAPONS VIOLATION
        and BURGLARY. These are the frequent crimes in US.
Step-7: For each of these 10 crimes, I have created line graphs for every crime wih respective time(in months of the year 2022) to observe the trend of the crimes.
Step-8: Later on, created a Story line for these 10 crimes by describing patterns and trends for each crime.

Observation: From these graphs I have observed that
             for THEFT, CRIMINAL DAMAGE and ASSAULT the rate of crimes are gradually decreasing.
             for BATTERY, the rate of crimes are in stable.
             for MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT and BURGLARY, the rate of crimes are in seasonal variations.
             for DECEPTIVE PRACTICE and OTHER OFFENSE, the rate of crimes are in low trend.
             for ROBBERY, the rate of crimes are gradually increasing.
             for WEAPONS VIOLATION, the rate of crimes are showing irregualar fluctuations.
